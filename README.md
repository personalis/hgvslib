Summary Information

Brief description
-----------------------------
hgvslib is a Python package for parsing variant strings described according to 
recommendations by the Human Genome Variation Society (HGVS). 

Purpose
-----------------------------
This package was written to assess the accuracy and concordance of HGVS variant 
expressions between different annotation tools (Variant Effect Predictor, Variation Reporter, 
SnpEff) and the COSMIC and ClinVar databases. The results of these comparisons have been 
summarized in the manuscript 'A variant by any name: quantifying annotation discordance across
tools and clinical databases': http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/05/19/054023.

Features
-----------------------------
This package provides the following functionalities:
   - Assess whether two HGVS strings describe the same variant
   - Normalize an HGVS string to a reduced form
   - Parse attributes of a variant object (e.g. location, transcript, bases,
     etc)

Current limitations
-----------------------------
Due to the complexity of HGVS syntax, this package currently does not support
comparisons of HGVS descriptions that require querying the accession sequence. 
For example, although ‘NM_006015.4:c.492_494dupCGC’ and 
'NM_006015.4:c.492_493insCGC’ describe the same variant, this package currently 
does not verify that CGC are duplicated bases according to the reference sequence. 

The package was developed for the purpose of comparing to a reference ‘truth’ 
test set, from which deviations in positional justification are assumed to be 
non-HGVS compliant.

If there are HGVS expressions that are not currently supported by this tool,
please make a comment or ping jennifer.lee.yen@gmail.com.


Future plans
-------------------
- Function to produce multiple HGVS aliases for the same variant from an expanded form
- Cross-verify duplication and insertion sequences
- Include HGVS validation test set (will be up soon)

-------------------

To install:

- clone directory to your home directory
git clone https://github.com/personalis/hgvslib.git

- add cloned directory to your python path:
1) in ~./bashrc: PYTHONPATH=/path_to_hgvslib/hgvslib:$PYTHONPATH
or
2) in python: sys.path.append('/path_to_hgvslib/hgvslib')

- May need to install requirements:
pip install -r requirements.txt


Unit Tests
-------------------

Over 115 unit tests have been created to test this code. 

To run:
```
python runtests.py -v
```

Example usage
-------------------

```python
from hgvslib.class_functions import compare_hgvs
import hgvslib.pHGVS as pHGVS

### Pandas usage

# Convert column of pHGVS syntax from singlet to triplet

df = pd.DataFrame({'mut_aa': ['p.T417_D419del2insY', 
                              'p.T46Hfs*35', 
                              'p.K355_K50del35insTPP', 
                              'p.N365_366insRDP', 
                              'p.R544X', 
                              'p.544fs36']})

# Convert column of singlet amino acid pHGVS to triplet form
df['mut_aa_triplet']        = df.mut_aa.apply(pHGVS.convert_phgvs_to_triplet)

# Normalize pHGVS syntax to snpEFf minimal pHGVS syntax 
df['mut_aa_norm']           = df.mut_aa.apply(pHGVS.get_alias)

# Get pHGVS variant consequence format
df['var_type']              = df.mut_aa.apply(pHGVS.get_var_type)


### HGVS syntax comparisons

# The library can also perform basic parsing steps from an HGVS name.

from hgvslib.pHGVS import pHGVS

hgvs = pHGVS('p.Glu412fs*')
hgvs.alias
'p.Glu412fs'

hgvs.type
'frameshift'


from hgvslib.cHGVS import cHGVS

hgvs = cHGVS('NM_000352.3:c.215-10A>G')

hgvs.transcript
'NM_000352.3'

hgvs.name
'c.215-10A>G'

hgvs.type
'substitution'


# Basic transcript manipulation

hgvs1 = 'NM_004958.3'
t = Transcript(hgvs1)
t.name = 'NM_004958.3'
t.version = '3'
t.accession = 'NM_004958'




# The following check returns “yes”, indicating that this is an exact match.

hgvs1 = 'NM_000352.3:c.123delA'
hgvs2 = 'NM_000352.3:c.123delA'
compare_hgvs(hgvs1, hgvs2)
'yes'


# The following checks return “yes_m”, indicating that these are equivalent 
# but not exact matches ('yes modified').

hgvs1 = 'NP_005647.3:p.Q29fs'
hgvs2 = 'NP_005647.3:p.Q29Efs*10’
compare_hgvs(hgvs1, hgvs2)
'yes_m'

hgvs1 = 'p.Ser78Ser='
hgvs2 = 'p.='
compare_hgvs(hgvs1, hgvs2)
'yes_m'

hgvs1 = 'p.Glu78fs'
hgvs2 = 'p.Glu78GlyfsTer7'
compare_hgvs(hgvs1, hgvs2)
'yes_m'

hgvs1 = 'NM_004360.3:c.48+6_48+7delinsTT'
hgvs2 = 'NM_004360.3:c.48+6_48+7delCCinsTT'
compare_hgvs(hgvs1, hgvs2)
'yes_m'

# The following check returns “no”, indicating that these are different
# variants.

hgvs1 = 'NM_000352.3:c.123delA'
hgvs2 = 'NM_000352.3:c.125delA'
compare_hgvs(hgvs1, hgvs2)
'no'

hgvs1 = 'NP_005647.3:p.Q29fs'
hgvs2 = 'NP_005647.3:p.Q29Ter'
compare_hgvs(hgvs1, hgvs2)
'no'





```

Example script
-------------------

The example script reads in a file to compare, for each variant, three different annotations 
with a reference HGVS string. The result of the comparison: an exact match 'yes', equivalent 
'yes_m' or non-match 'no'.

Note: the example VCF file hgvs_test_cases.vcf has been normalized with vt-normalize
https://github.com/atks/vt.

 
```python
python example/example_check_variants.py --infile example/test_file.txt
```
